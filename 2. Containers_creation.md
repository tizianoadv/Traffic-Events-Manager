# Containers Creation

- Codes to create LXC and Docker containers

## Vehicles

Although in the introduction it is said that there must be three types of vehicles and it is represented by three different containers, only one container is required. Therefore, it was decided to create only one LXC container. This container contains all three types of vehicles, it is managed by the logic of the application. The container was built from an Ubuntu 20:04 image because it is quite easy to develop applications on it and to configure networks.

> sudo lxc-create -n vehicles -t ubuntu:20.04

## Gateway

As mentioned in the introduction the gateway is a Docker container, it was chosen to create it from an Ubuntu 20:04 image for the same reason as for the container representing vehicles. The gateway can both receive messages from vehicles and forward them to the hub through MQTT communication protocol. So, a MQTT broker is installed on it with Mosquito solution. A shared folder was created between the host and the container to develop scripts directly inside the container using an IDE.

>sudo docker create -it --name gateway -v \
>/home/tub/mqtt_scripts/gateway/:/home/gateway/scripts/ >ubuntu /bin/bash

## DHCP

The application designed emulates real-world traffic monitoring applications, and in this kind of app, vehicles arrive into a limited zone covered by a gateway. So as to send data to the gateway, vehicles need IP addresses. Therefore, this emulation, offers an IP addresses delivering system, through a DHCP server. This server is created from a Docker image called networkboot/dhcp. Another subsection below shows its network configuration a how it must be run.

The dhcp container is configured to deliver IP addresses from 172.16.0.2 to 172.16.3.253, that means 1020 IP address are available for vehicles, that fulfil requirements of the application

> cd
>
> sudo mkdir data/
>
> sudo touch data/dhcpd.conf
>
> sudo vi data/dhcpd.conf

```Bash
authoritative;

default-lease-time 7200;
max-lease-time 7200;

subnet 172.16.0.0 netmask 255.255.252.0 {
        option subnet-mask 255.255.252.0;
        range 172.16.0.2 172.16.3.253;
}
```

## Hub

About the hub, it is also a Docker container, it is built from an Ubuntu 20:04 Docker image. It receives data from the gateway so a Mosquitto broker is installed in the container. The container is called eventhub and it was created by sharing a folder with the host.

> sudo docker create -it --name eventhub -v \ /home/tub/mqtt_scripts/eventhub/:/home/eventhub/scripts/ ubuntu /bin/bash

## Web server

The web server is a Docker container, built from an Ubuntu 20:04 Docker image, it receives data from the hub through the MQTT protocol. Thus, a Mosquitto broker is installed. Moreover, it was decided to run an embedded web server Flask, because of its lightness and its high abilities of configuration. The web server container called webserver is created sharing a folder with the host and forwarding its 11080 port with the 10080 port of the host, which is necessary to get access to the webserver from the host during the development period.

> sudo docker create -it --name webserver -p 10080:11080 \
-v /home/tub/mqtt_scripts/webserver/:/home/webserver/scripts/ ubuntu /bin/bash

## Storage server

The storage server is a Docker container, built from an Ubuntu 20:04 Docker image, it stores information that comes from the buffer through AMQP communication protocol. Redis, the storage solution chosen was chosen to fulfill the requirements of storage and lightness. The container called database shares a folder with the host.

> sudo docker create -it --name database -v \
/home/tub/mqtt_scripts/database/:/home/database/scripts/ ubuntu /bin/bash

## Buffer

The buffer is a Docker container, built from an Ubuntu 20:04 Docker image. The first purpose is to receive information from the hub through MQTT communication protocol, so a Mosquitto broker is installed in it. The second objective is to share these messages into queues to the storage server through AMQP communication protocol. Therefore, It was to run a RabbitMQ server on it. The buffer is called buffer and was created by sharing a folder with the host.

> sudo docker create -it --name buffer -v \
/home/tub/mqtt_scripts/buffer/:/home/buffer/scripts/ ubuntu /bin/bash

## Infrastructure manager

The infrastructure manager is represented by a virtual machine that uses an Alpine Linux virtual version. It was created using the qcow2 drive format, the run command is shown in the following section.

> curl -o alpine.iso `https://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.15/releases/x86_64/alpine-virt-3.15.0-x86_64.iso`
>
> sudo qemu-img create -f qcow2 alpine.img 2G
>
> sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256 -k fr -drive file=alpine.img,format=qcow2 -boot d -cdrom alpine.iso -nographic
>
> sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -m 256 -k fr -drive file=alpine.img,format=qcow2 -nographic
>
> sudo vi powerUpQemu.sh

```Bash
#!/bin/bash
qemu-system-x86_64 \
    -m 256 \
    -k fr \
    -drive file=alpine.img, format=qcow2 \
    -nographic \
    -netdev tap,ifname=tap0,id=nettap,script=no,downscript=no \
    -device e1000,netdev=nettap,mac=52:55:00::d1:55:19 \
    -netdev user,id=netweb \
    -device e1000,netdev=netweb
```
