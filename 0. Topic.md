# Topic : Traffic Events Manager

## Context

In the matter of applying knowledge acquired in multiple fields during the first semester of Master Networks and Telecommunication, such as system administration, virtualization, distributed systems, and computing, it was asked to develop an architecture that emulates traffic events, by sending CAM and DENM messages as vehicles do while they enter into a zone covered by a monitoring system, and managing those messages received with multiple services

## Application functionalities

The following diagram presents technologies the components, protocols, and services that compose the architecture.

### Vehicles

On the diagram, vehicles are divided into three different components regarding their category, cars, trucks, and motorcycles. In the application, they are represented by LXC containers and send CAM and DENM messages over a network to reach a gateway using the MQTT protocol. The contains of the CAM and DENM messages are listed below. The period of sending of these messages depends on the speed of the vehicle. They are sent every second if the speed of the vehicle is under 90 Km/H and are sent with a frequency of 10 Hertz if the speed is above 90 Km/H or equal to this speed. It must be noted that messages may be lost because of multiple different issues.

### CAM & DENM Messages

CAM messages (Cooperative Awareness Message), represent the state of a vehicle and are constituted of :

1. Station Id (identification of a vehicle)

2. Station Type:

- Ordinary vehicles (5)

- Emergency vehicles (10)

- Road operator vehicles (15)

3. Speed

4. Heading (The angle compared the direction of the north)

5. GPS position

DENM messages (Decentralized Event Notification Message), represent events that occur on roads and are constituted of:

1. Station Id (identification of a vehicle)

2. Station Type:

- Ordinary vehicles (5)

- Emergency vehicles (10)

- Road operator vehicles (15)

3. Cause (type of events represented on a byte)

- Word on the road (3)

- Accident (4)

- Traffic jam (5)

- Slippery road (6)

- Fog (7)

- SubCause code (subtype)

- GPS position

### The gateway

In the application, the gateway is represented by a Docker container. Its purpose is to receive all messages from vehicles, analyse them and forward to the hub useful information such as accidents, knowing that accidents occur when at least two vehicles notify an accident, and traffic jam, knowing that traffic jams occur when at least three vehicles notify a speed above 90 Km/H, using MQTT communication protocol.

### The Hub

In the application, the hub is once again represented by a Docker container. Its purpose is to receive data from the gateway and forward them both a web server and a buffer through MQTT communication protocol.

### The buffer

In the application, the buffer is once again represented by a Docker container. Its purpose is to put events sent by the gateway into queues using AMQP communication protocol, so as to be collected by the storage server.

### The storage server

In the application, the buffer is once again represented by a Docker container. Its purpose is to subscribe to a queue of the buffer and store data into a light database storage solution.

### The web server

In the application, the buffer is once again represented by a Docker container. Its purpose is to subscribe to events forwarded by the gateway and print them in real-time into a web page during the entire duration of the accident.

### The infrastructure manager

In the application, the buffer is once again represented by a virtual machine supported by the QEMU technology. Its purpose is to control all components excluding vehicles, by offering a DNS service and ensuring system logs centralization.
