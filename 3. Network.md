# Network

The application is divided into two parts.

1. Left part contains all containers representing vehicles the gateway and a bridge (br0) that connects vehicles with the gateway.

2. Right parts contains all containers which manage traffic events, the right part of the gateway and the bridge (br1) that connects all of these containers.

## Left part

We suppose that toward 1000 vehicles will be present within the covering zone of the gateway. Therefore, 10-bits of the IP address must be available for vehicles, because 2^10 = 1024 addresses. Thus, we considering the following IP addressing plan:

|                  Bridge br0 that connects vehicles and the gateway                 |   172.16.0.1  |
|                 Beginning of the range of IP addresses for vehicles                |   172.16.0.2  |
| End of the range of IP addresses for vehicles (total: 1020 IP addresses available) |  172.16.3.253 |
|                                   Gateway address                                  |  172.16.3.254 |
|                                  Broadcast address                                 |  172.16.3.255 |

## Configuration

### Bridges

Bridges for both networks were created using the Docker engine.

***Net0: br0 creation***

> sudo docker network create --driver=bridge -o "com.docker.network.bridge.name=br0" \
--subnet=172.16.0.0/22 net0

***Net1: br1 creation***

>sudo docker network create --driver=bridge -o "com.docker.network.bridge.name=br1" \
--subnet=192.168.0.0/24 net1

***Setting up IP addresses***

> sudo vi /etc/netplan/...yaml

```Bash
network:
    ethernets:
        enp0s3:
            dhcp4: true
        enp0s8:
            dhcp4: true
    bridges:
        br0:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses: [172.16.0.1/22]
        br1:
            dhcp4: false
            addresses: [192.168.0.1/24]
    
    version: 2
```

### TAP interfaces

> sudo ip tuntap add dev tap0 mode tap
>
> sudo ip link set tap0 master br1

### Vehicles LXC container

***Configuration on the host***

> sudo vi /var/lib/lxc/vehicles/config

```Bash
# Network Configuration
# To connect vehicles to br0
lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = br0
lxc.net.0.veth.pair = br0-vehicles
lxc.net.0.flags = up
lxc.net.0.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:a5:b7:e9

# To get acces to internet from the vehicles container
lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
lxc.net.0.veth.pair = br0-vehicles
lxc.net.0.flags = up
lxc.net.0.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:a5:b7:e1
```

***Configuration on the guest***

> sudo vi /etc/netplan/...yaml

```Bash
network:
    ethernets:
        eth0: {dhcp4: true}
        eth1: {dhcp4: true}
    version: 2
```

### Containers

To connect all containers to their bridges, the following command must be used:

> sudo docker network connect --ip IPofContainer RelatedNetwork NameofContainer

For instance, the gateway is connected thanks to the following command:

> sudo docker network connect --ip 172.16.3.254 net0 gateway

## Port forwarding to get access from Windows host to webserver through Ubuntu 20.04

> sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i enp0s8 -p tcp --dport 80 -j DNAT --to 192.168.0.4:11080
